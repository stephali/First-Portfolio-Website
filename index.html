  <p>
   My name is Stephanie Ali and I am currently a freshman at Florida Gulf Coast University studying Software Engineering.<br/>
   My passions delve around the dynamic worlds of business and technology. <br/>
  </br>
  Since I was very little, I always loved technology. I would always keep up to date with the latest tech in the market.</br>
  I loved learning about the new details and features.Something about the mystery surrounding the way they worked had always sparked interest in me.
