      <p>
      My name is Stephanie Ali and I am currently a freshman at Florida Gulf Coast University studying Software Engineering.<br/>
      My passions delve around the dynamic worlds of business and technology. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Since I was very little, I always loved everything tech. I would always keep up to date with the latest tech in the market.<br/>
      I would spend hours researching and learning about the newer details and features just for the fun of it.<br/>
      Something about the mystery surrounding the way they worked had always sparked interest in me.<br/>
      This interest led me to choose Software Engineering as my field of study. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I love to create. One of my biggest ambitions is to be able to create something meaningful and bring it out to the world.<br/>
      To make an impact on the world for a better good is what I always aim to do.
