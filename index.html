      <p>
      My name is Stephanie Ali and I am currently a freshman at Florida Gulf Coast University studying Software Engineering.<br/>
      My passions delve around the dynamic worlds of business and technology.

        Since I was very little, I always loved everything tech. I would always keep up to date with the latest tech in the market.<br/>
        I would spend hours researching and learning about the newer details and features just for the fun of it.<br/>
        Something about the mystery surrounding the way they worked had always sparked interest in me.<br/>
        This interest led me to choose Software Engineering as my field of study.

          <p>
          I love to create. One of my biggest ambitions is to be able to create something meaningful and bring it out to the world.<br/>
          To make an impact on the world for a better good is what I always aim to do.
